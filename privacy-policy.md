   PRIVACY POLICY

    Last Updated: September 12, 2025

    Your privacy matters. This Policy explains how Notori handles your information.

    1. WHAT WE DO NOT COLLECT
    • No sale of your data. No ad networks integrated.
    • We do not run our own servers to store your personal content.
    • No third-party cookies inside the App.

    2. DATA STORAGE
    • Notes, reminders, and related content are stored locally on your device.
    • If you enable iCloud/CloudKit, content may sync across your devices via Apple’s services.
    • Encryption and security are provided by iOS/iCloud; manage your Apple ID security.

    3. SYSTEM PERMISSIONS
    We may request access to:
    • Calendar – to create/display events you request.
    • Reminders – to create/manage tasks you request.
    • Notifications – to alert you at dates/times you choose.
    • Microphone – for voice notes (processed on-device).
    • Photos/Camera – only when you attach images.
    • iCloud – for sync, if you enable it.
    You can revoke any permission in iOS Settings.

    4. AI & CLOUD PROCESSING (OPT-IN)
    • By default, cloud AI is OFF. You can enable/disable it in Settings → Privacy & AI.
    • When enabled, the App may send the text you type and, only if you allow it, the images you attach, to your selected AI provider (OpenAI and/or Google Gemini) solely to obtain a response for you.
    • We do not train our own models with your personal content.
    • Providers process data under their own terms and privacy policies; please review them.
    • You can choose a preferred provider (Automatic/OpenAI/Gemini/None). Choosing “None” keeps processing on-device or falls back to local logic, with reduced capabilities.

    5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES WE USE
    • Apple (App Store, iCloud/CloudKit, Notifications, Calendars, Reminders).
    • RevenueCat – subscription status management.
    • Google Sign-In – optional sign-in (if you use it).
    • Facebook SDK – may record app events; tracking requires your consent under Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT).
    • OpenAI / Google Gemini – only if you enable cloud AI features.

    6. ANALYTICS / TRACKING
    • We do not use third-party ad networks.
    • Facebook SDK app events, if present, follow your ATT choice; if you deny tracking, we do not track you across apps/sites.
    • You can change ATT permissions anytime in iOS Settings.

    7. DATA SECURITY
    • We rely on iOS security (passcode/biometrics recommended).
    • iCloud data is protected by Apple’s encryption.
    • We do not operate servers to store your personal notes.

    8. DATA RETENTION & DELETION
    • You can delete individual notes, reminders, and events anytime.
    • You can delete all app data via in-app settings.
    • Uninstalling the App deletes local data on that device.
    • iCloud content is managed in iOS Settings → Apple ID → iCloud.

    9. YOUR RIGHTS (GDPR / CCPA)
    • Access: your data is available on your device and iCloud (if enabled).
    • Deletion: you can delete data in the App; uninstall removes local data.
    • Portability: you can export notes from the App.
    • Consent: you can enable/disable cloud AI and tracking permissions anytime.

    10. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
    • The App is rated 4+. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
    • Parental controls are available via iOS Screen Time.

    11. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
    • We may update this Policy; significant changes may be notified in-app.
    • Please review periodically.

    12. CONTACT
    • Privacy questions: support@notori.app

    13. COMPLIANCE
    • We aim to comply with GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines.
